st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

This build has my own set of patches, and uses scripts from
Luke Smith's build: https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st.

Ctrl+Shift+Enter to open another terminal in the same directory.

The following require dmenu:

Alt+l = open urls
Alt+y = copy urls
Alt+o = copy command output


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
